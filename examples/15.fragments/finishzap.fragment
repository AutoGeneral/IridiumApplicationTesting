  Scenario: Save the results
    And the application is spidered timing out after "15" seconds
    And the attack strength is set to "HIGH"
    And the active scanner is run
    And the ZAP XML report is written to the file "zapreport.xml"
    # Ignore X-Frame-Options Header Error
    And the following false positives are ignored
      | url                              | parameter          | cweId      | wascId   |
      | https://bodgeit.herokuapp.com.*  |                    | 16         | 15       |
    Then no "Low" or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present for the base url "^https://bodgeit.herokuapp.com"
