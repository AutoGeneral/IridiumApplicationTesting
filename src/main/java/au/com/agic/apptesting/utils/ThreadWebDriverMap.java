/**
 * This class maintains a mapping between a thread id and the Selenium desired capabilities that
 * will be used by the web driver created inside that thread. <p> This is necessary because Cucumber
 * doesn't really support the notion of running tests in multiple threads with multiple
 * configurations (http://www.drobsonconsulting.co.uk/cucumber-and-concurrency/). But this is
 * exactly what we want to do when running against BrowserStack. <p> So this class provides a lookup
 * that is linked to a thread id. This means that when cucumber is creating instances of the Step
 * definitions, the actual configuration of the web driver can be retrieved against a specific
 * thread. In this way we can have multiple threads each creating webdrivers that are consistent for
 * that thread, but different to the other threads.
