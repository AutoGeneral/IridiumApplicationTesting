# The following line is the header line and determines the dataset keys for each CSV position...
Sometimes empty,	Sometimes null,	Surrounded in spaces

# These are comments and can be where you would expect the header to be if you want.
# Comments cannot go at the end of a CSV row though.
# Empty lines are cool too.

# Spaces in the values are trimmed either side, unless you quote them.
# If a value is not to be set, use the string UNDEFINED without quotes.
# "UNDEFINED" is also interpretted as not set.
# Adjacent commas are interpreted as an empty string, not unset value.
