## Important Announcements

The location of the JAR file that is referenced by the Web Start JNLP files has changed recently. It used to be https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/ag-iridium/, so your JNLP files used to look like this:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/ag-iridium/">  
    ...  
</jnlp>
```
The new file location is https://s3.amazonaws.com/iridium-release, so your JNLP files should look like this:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="https://s3.amazonaws.com/iridium-release">  
    ...  
</jnlp>
```
Files from https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/ag-iridium/won't be updated, and the certificate used to sign the JAR file has expired, so you will most likely receive a warning if you do not update the location.
